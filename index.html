          <h4>Hi and Welcome!</h4>
        </p>

        <p>
          I am an IT QA Analyst, who is also an aspiring Web Developer. I have a
          passion for learning new things and solving problems to expand on my
          career as well as my personal development. I am of the generation when
          the internet became a household topic. My desire to become a Web
          Developer has since grown. I have denomstrative experience creating
          applications through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the use of
          multiple APIs and Firebase for storing data. Along with the basics of
          CSS, I have used Bootstrap to creating a cleaner design.

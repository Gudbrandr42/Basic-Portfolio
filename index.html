        <p>
        My name is Mark Bullard.  I have a passion for writing, singing, reading, and learning. You will also find me, sometimes, working on a crossword puzzle or taking some kind of quiz.
        I was born and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. I entered into the military (the US Army Reserves) at the age of 17, finishing Basic Training and AIT less than a couple of years
        after I graduated. I've lived in Illinois and NYC. I started my college education in Illinois at Western Illinois University. I pursued a degree in Instructional Design and Technology
        with a concentration in Human Factors and Interface Design.  I was always interested in becoming a web developer, but I was never good at math and we did not have the courses that are
        offered today. Completing my degree at another institution really reignited the fire of persuing the career of becoming a Web Developer.

        I taught myself some things, but I never had the will power and focus to continue on learning.  So here I am now, working as a software tester in my first IT role and I am enrolled in a
        boot camp to become a full stack developer. Slowly but surely, I will make this dream of mine become true.

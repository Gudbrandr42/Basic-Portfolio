## Design

I used a simplistic approach that suits the needs of clearly showcasing my works, as well as being somewhat appealing. I have plans to refactor in the future, but it's current state shall suffice. The hyperlinks I have used helps the user find out more information on what I have provided and there is even some functionality on a level of being mobile friendly when the user clicks/taps on the phone number.  It takes my number and has it ready to dial when this page is viewed on a mobile phone.

## Functionality

As of this point in time, the functionality of the site is simple in regards to links and buttons.  On the Index and Portfolio pages, links are embedded to do multiple things. For instance, the images on the portfolio page are embedded with links that take the user over to the application's web page. It opens up a new tab, while doing so. The same applies to the links on the Index page.  The link to my resume, my GitHub, Project(s), etc. all point to opening a new tab.  So far, this works when viewed from my mobile phone (Google Pixel 2 XL).

## Issues

I did happen to run into a lot of issues with CSS, but without the use of pages like stackoverflow.com and W3Schools.com, I would not have overcome them. One particular issue was with the images on the Portfolio page.  As I made adjustments to the the new photos I used, the pictures got out of alignment.  Initial attempts are resizing or trying to realign them failed.  I found that I was actually looking at the wrong block in the css file to make the adjustments to the images and their titles. Once I realized what block actually contolled the behavior of the images and its alignment, it was easy to see how changing the size in that block actually put them back to looking more clean.  Another issue has been trying to properly convert a googleDocs version of my resume into a good saved PDF format.  For some reason, it is reporting as an invalid format of the file type and won't open.
